# Social Media APP (REST API)

This is a project to develop a fullstack MERN Social Media App in order for me to learn the development process of fullstack applications. This API will serve as the backend of the Social Media project.

## 1. Package Installations and Setup

```
npm i express mongoose dotenv helmet morgan nodemon bcrypt
```
- `Helmet.js` is an open source JavaScript library that helps you secure your Node.js application by setting several HTTP headers. It acts as a middleware for Express and similar technologies, automatically adding or removing HTTP headers to comply with web security standards. Although not a silver bullet, Helmet makes it harder for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities. It helps to protect Node.js Express apps from common security threats such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and click-jacking attacks.

- `Morgan` is another HTTP request logger middleware for Node. js. It simplifies the process of logging requests to your application.
